## üéØ Overview

**UID Brute Smarter** is a professional-grade security research tool designed for **authorized penetration testing** and **access control system auditing**. Built on the Flipper Zero platform, it provides advanced NFC key management capabilities with intelligent pattern detection for comprehensive security assessments.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This tool is intended for **authorized security testing only**. Users must obtain proper authorization before testing any systems they do not own or have explicit permission to test.

- **Key Tracking**: Per-key metadata including filename, UID, and load time
- **Visual Key Browser**: Browse and manage loaded keys with UID display
- **Bulk Operations**: Load multiple keys or unload all with one tap
- **Memory Safety**: Proper cleanup and memory management

### üß† Intelligent Pattern Detection
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Detects +1, +K, and 16-bit counter patterns
- **Range Generation**: Automatically creates comprehensive test ranges
- **Pattern Validation**: Ensures generated ranges are within safe bounds
- **Configurable Limits**: Prevent excessive range generation

### ‚öôÔ∏è Professional Configuration

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Security Testing Workflow

#### 1. **Authorization**
- Ensure you have **explicit written authorization** for target systems
- Document scope and testing parameters
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

#### 2. **Key Collection**
```
Main Menu ‚Üí Load Cards ‚Üí Select NFC Files
```
- Browse to `/ext/nfc/` folder
- Select authorized test cards (.nfc files)
- Review key details popup before loading
- Monitor "Loaded X keys" confirmation

#### 3. **Configuration**
```
Main Menu ‚Üí Configure
```
- **Delay**: 100-1000ms between attempts
- **Pause Every**: 0-100 attempts
- **Pause Duration**: 0-10 seconds

#### 4. **Key Management**
```
Main Menu ‚Üí View Keys
```
- See loaded keys with UIDs
- Remove individual keys
- Bulk unload all keys
- Real-time count updates

#### 5. **Testing**
```
Main Menu ‚Üí Start Brute Force
```
- Review generated range before starting
- Monitor progress in real-time
- Stop safely if needed
- Review results responsibly

### Example Security Test

```bash
# 1. Load test keys
Load Cards ‚Üí /ext/nfc/test_cards/
# Shows: "Key 1 (A0B1C2D3) from test_card_01.nfc"

# 2. Configure for authorized testing
Configure ‚Üí Delay: 500ms, Pause: 50 attempts

# 3. Review key list
View Keys ‚Üí "Loaded Keys (3)"

# 4. Execute authorized test
Start Brute Force ‚Üí Monitor progress
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Ethics

### Authorized Use Only
- **Explicit Permission Required**: Test only systems you own or have written authorization
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define testing boundaries with stakeholders
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report findings through appropriate channels

### Built-in Safeguards
- **Range Limiting**: Prevents excessive brute-force attempts
- **Configurable Delays**: Protects against system overload
- **Safe Interruption**: Graceful stopping mechanisms
- **Memory Safety**: Proper cleanup prevents system issues

### Legal Compliance
- **Follow Local Laws**: Comply with all applicable cybersecurity regulations
- **Document Authorization**: Maintain records of testing permissions
- **Professional Ethics**: Adhere to security research best practices
